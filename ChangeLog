xx/10/2003 - 1.8.0beta - Work in progress.
	- Further work on attribute resizing.
	- Fix two logic inversion bugs in dir.c. Thanks to Russ Christensen for
	  finding the first one.
	- Fix attempt to release I30 internal constant. (Russ Christensen)
	- Fix off-by-one error in disk_io.c::ntfs_cluster_{read,write}(). (Ian
	  Jackson)
	- Add -fms-extensions when compiling with gcc-3.2+.
	- Update for newer autoconf/automake.
	- Abstract low level device operations (include/device,h and
	  libntfs/device.c) and adapt utilities to changes.
	- Added ntfsclone utility written by Szabolcs Szakacsits.
	- Added ntfsls utility written by Lode Leroy.
	- Fix bugs in dir.c::ntfs_readdir() where we try to close ia_na when
	  it is NULL.
	- Return errno ENOTDIR from dir.c::ntfs_readdir() when called with a
	  file inode.
	- Fix a silly bug in attrib.c::ntfs_external_attr_find() which caused
	  us to always return the same attribute during an enumeration as soon
	  as the end of the attributes to be enumerated was reached thus
	  causing the program doing the enumeration to hang in a tight loop.
	  NOTE: There is still work to do as ctx->al_entry is set to NULL
	  instead of to the position in the attribute list at which to insert.
	- Added man pages for the new utilities (Richard Russon and me).
	- Lots of extensions and cleanups to ntfsls.
	- Move common bits from disk_io.c into device.c and rename the Unix io
	  specific code that remains to unix_io.c to complement win32_io.c.
	- Integrate win32_io.c into the build process so win32_io ops are used
	  when compiling under Cygwin and standard Unix style io ops are used
	  otherwise.
	- Other assorted bugfixes and developments (see NEWS and bk changes).

13/02/2003 - 1.7.1 - Urgent bug fixes.
	- Urgent bug fixes in ntfsresize (Szabolcs Szakacsits):
	  - compare_bitmaps(): fix another bug reporting the correct cluster
	    mismatch
	  - walk_inodes(): fix leaking ntfs_inode in certain cases
	  - delete redundant and unused MFT_RECORD *mrec from ntfs_resize_t
	- Urgent bug fixes in libntfs (thanks to Szaka for bug reports):
	  - attrib.c::ntfs_external_attr_find(): broken error detection
	  - mft.c::ntfs_mft_records_write(): stupid buffer overflow bug (ouch!)

12/02/2003 - 1.7.0 - Small bug fixes and updates.
	- Bug fixes in mapping pairs array generation in libntfs.
	- Bug fixes and updates in ntfsresize. (Szabolcs Szakacsits)
	- Tidyups and standardisations. (Richard Russon)

18/01/2003 - 1.7.0beta - Library rewrite and many new tools.
	- Highlights of this release are the now hopefully stable API sported
	  by an almost completely rewritten library and the new utilities;
		ntfsresize, ntfsundelete, and ntfslabel.
	  Note this is a beta release so it may not be free of bugs.
	- New tool ntfslabel written by Matthew Fanto with a few cleanups from
	  me to make it fit in with e2label better.
	- Add man page for ntfslabel.
	- New tool, ntfsundelete, written by Richard Russon.
	- New tool, ntfsresize, written by Szakacsits Szabolcs.
	- Extend ntfs_mount() to also read in the volume label.
	- Silence verbosity of output from ntfs_mount(). It is now only output
	  if ./configure was run with --enable-debug.
	- Remove a LOT of dead code. Massive cleanup.
	- Add full attribute search context and allocation/init/deallocation
	  functions (see attrib.c).
	- Remove find_first_attr(). Just use ntfs_attr_get_search_ctx() +
	  ntfs_attr_find() which has the same effect.
	- Rewrite disk_io.[ch] and mft.[ch] defining new access API:
		disk_io.[ch] provide:	ntfs_p{read,write}(),
					ntfs_mst_p{read,write}(), and
					ntfs_cluster_{read,write}().
		mft.[ch] provide:	ntfs_mft_record_{read,write}(),
					ntfs_mft_records_{read,write}(), and
					ntfs_mft_record_get_data_size().
	- When writing mft records using the mft.c::ntfs_mft_record{s,}_write()
	  interface, the mft mirror is now updated automatically.
	- Add -Wall to compiler options.
	- Fix minor error code path bugs in mkntfs.c that showed up with -Wall.
	- Fix all compiler warnings that showed up with -Wall.
	- Add new API function, provided by mft.[ch]: ntfs_file_record_read().
	- Add new API calls provided by unistr.[ch]:
		ntfs_ucstombs() and ntfs_mbstoucs().
	- Define API for mst.[ch] providing:
		ntfs_mst_post_read_fixup(),
		ntfs_mst_pre_write_fixup(), and
		ntfs_mst_post_write_fixup().
	- Define API for bootsect.[ch] providing:
		ntfs_boot_sector_is_ntfs().
	- Add beginning of new API with new files inode.[ch] providing:
		ntfs_inode_{open,close)(), and
		ntfs_extent_inode_open().
		- Note the inode related API is subject to change.
	- Start defining API provided by attrib.[ch]:
		ntfs_attr_search_ctx typedef,
		ntfs_attr_{get,put,reinit}_search_ctx(), and
		ntfs_attr_lookup().
	- Add a TODO.libntfs laying down my personal roadmap for the library.
	- Remove ntfs_attr_find() from API, everyone must use ntfs_attr_lookup()
	  instead.
	- Rename all attribute name constants from $blah to AT_blah.
	- Rename all system file constants from FILE_$blah to FILE_blah.
	- Port ntfs_attr_lookup() stuff from ntfs tng driver.
	- Implement loading of extent inodes. They are attached on open to the
	  base inode and are cached there until the base inode is closed.
	- Cleanup/streamline include file dependencies.
	- Port attribute list merging code from ntfs tng driver. API to follow.
	- Allocate a ntfs_volume in mkntfs and start initializing it instead
	  of using the opt global structure. Necessary so can call the
	  modified ntfs_mapping_pairs_decompress() from mkntfs.c.
	- Add libntfs/debug.c providing:
		ntfs_debug_runlist_dump().
	- Add new API call ntfs_check_if_mounted() to volume.[ch]. (Matthew
	  Fanto, me)
	- Do folding assisting cleanups. (Richard Russon, me)
	- Add new API call ntfs_boot_sector_is_ntfs() provided by bootsect.[hc].
	- Define and write more API calls provided by attrib.[ch]:
		ntfs_attr_map_runlist(),
		ntfs_attr_vcn_to_lcn(),
		ntfs_attr_find_vcn(),
		ntfs_attr_init(),
		ntfs_attr_{open,close}(),
		ntfs_attr_size_bounds_check(),
		ntfs_attr_can_be_non_resident().
	- Add new field mftmirr_size to ntfs_volume structure and initialize
	  it to the number of mft records stored in the mft mirror in
	  ntfs_mount().
	- Add new fields mftmirr_ni and mftmirr_na to ntfs_volume structure and
	  initialize them in ntfs_mount to the $MFTMirr inode and $DATA
	  attribute. Ditto for mft_ni ($MFT inode), mft_na ($MFT/$DATA),
	  mftbmp_na ($MFT/$BITMAP), lcnbmp_ni ($Bitmap inode), and
	  lcnbmp_na ($Bitmap/$DATA). Remove previous fields replaced by these.
	- Rename a few fields in ntfs_volume structure to make them shorter,
	  e.g. now have nr_mft_records and nr_clusters.
	- Add new API for doing I/O on both normal and multi sector transfer
	  protected ntfs attributes described by the ntfs_attr structure,
	  provided by attrib.[hc] (note writing is still restricted to
	  overwrite only):
		ntfs_attr_p{read,write}(), and
		ntfs_attr_mst_p{read,write}().
	- Fix detection of read-only mounts in volume.c::ntfs_mntent_check().
	- Start modularising ntfs_mount():
		- Split off the boot sector parsing code and move it to
		  bootsect.c::ntfs_boot_sector_parse().
		- Move $MFT loading and parsing code to separate function
		  volume.c::ntfs_mft_load().
		- Move $MFTMirr loading and parsing code to
		  volume.c::ntfs_mftmirr_load().
		- Move all startup code (loading and parsing of bootsector,
		  $MFT, and $MFTMirr) to volume.c::ntfs_volume_startup().
	- Update ntfsfix to above modularisation.
	- Add detection of read-write mounted devices to ntfsfix and refuse to
	  operate on them.
	- POSIXify libntfs/disk_io.c. All functions now return partial reads
	  and writes and deal with end of file properly. Affected functions:
	  	ntfs_p{read,write}(),
		ntfs_mst_p{read,write}(), and
		ntfs_cluster_{read,write}().
	- Change ntfsfix to take into account the automatic mft mirror updates.
	- Add new API provided by new files dir.[ch]:
		ntfs_inode_lookup_by_name(), and
		ntfs_readdir().
	- We now use u8, u16, u32, u64, s8, s16, s32, and s64 types and we
	  typedef them ourselves from the C99 standard uint8_t, etc types which
	  IMO are braindamaged.
	- Better gcc detection in 'configure.in'. (Szakacsits Szabolcs)
	  Tested with:	egcs-1.0.3 (egcs-2.90.29), egcs-1.1.2 (egcs-2.91.66),
			gcc 2.95.3, 2.96 (from RH 7.1 and 7.3), and 3.0.4.
	- Enable enumeration of attributes using ntfs_attr_lookup() which is
	  requested by passing a type of AT_UNUSED (or simply zero) to
	  ntfs_attr_lookup(). (Based on initial patch by Szakacsits Szabolcs.)
	- Fix two minor buglets in ntfs_external_attr_find() where we would
	  continue the search when we detect a mismatched type and/or name
	  instead of aborting and returning error EIO to flag the corruption.
	- Add new syntactic sugar API provided by attrib.h:
		ntfs_attrs_walk(). (Szakacsits Szabolcs)
	- Add new API for compressing runlists into mapping pairs arrays
	  provided by runlist.[hc] (some adapted from mkntfs.c):
		ntfs_rl_vcn_to_lcn(),
		ntfs_rl_pwrite(),
		ntfs_runlists_merge(),
		ntfs_mapping_pairs_decompress(),
		ntfs_get_nr_significant_bytes(),
		ntfs_get_size_for_mapping_pairs(),
		ntfs_write_significant_bytes(),
		ntfs_mapping_pairs_build(), and
		ntfs_rl_truncate(). -- WIP
	- Convert mkntfs.c to the above API.
	- Implement attrib.[hc]::ntfs_rl_pwrite() as a low level scatter write
	  function analogous in functionality to mkntfs.c::ntfs_rlwrite() but
	  with arguments more like ntfs_attr_pwrite() to allow for more
	  flexible use.
	- Don't use string concatenation with __FUNCTION__ as gcc-3.x don't
	  like it.
	- Move runlist functions to runlist.[hc]. (Richard Russon)
	- Add new API to volume.[hc] and use it (Szakacsits Szabolcs):
		ntfs_version_is_supported(),
		NTFS_V{1_[12],2_x,3_[01]}() macros,
		ntfs_logfile_reset(), and
		ntfs_volume_set_flags().
	- Change size autodetection of non-block device files in mkntfs to use
	  the stat returned file size rather than the block allocation count to
	  cope with pre-created sparse files.
	- Remove GPL message text from usage information in mkntfs.
	- The word is "runlist", not "run_list", "run list", or "run-list".
	- Prefix all functions with "ntfs_" and make the names of the form
	  "ntfs_object_action()". Keep this for all future functions!
	- Change unistr.c::ntfs_names_are_equal() to return TRUE when both
	  names have zero length. Thanks to Leonard Norrgard for spotting this.
	- Fix bug in ntfs_external_attr_find(). (Szakacsits Szabolcs)
	- Fix stupid logic inversion bug in ntfs_extent_inode_open(). Same bug
	  was fixed in the NTFS kernel driver over six months ago but the fix
	  was never taken over to libntfs. (Szakacsits Szabolcs)
	- Fix stupid bug in ntfs_ucsncmp(). Spotted by Leonard Norrgard.
	- Fix bug where the call to ntfs_attr_{put,reinit}_search_ctx() would
	  free the extent inode attached to the search context but leave it
	  attached to the base inode, so this would lead to memory corruption
	  and worse problems. Thanks to Szakacsits Szabolcs for spotting this.
	  We now don't close extent inodes any more at all and just leave it
	  to the closing of the base inode to dispose of all the extent inodes.
	- Add sanity check to ntfs_inode_close() to detect attempts at closing
	  extent inodes.
	- Don't free extent inodes in attrib.c! (Szakacsits Szabolcs)
	- Return the attribute list attribute when enumerating attributes, too.
	  Thanks to Szakacsits Szabolcs for pointing this problem out.
	- New API function provided by unistr.[hc] and use it in mkntfs:
		ntfs_ucsnlen().
	- New API function provided by attrib.[hc] and use it in mkntfs:
		ntfs_resident_attr_value_resize(),
		ntfs_attr_truncate(). -- WIP
	- New API functions provided by inode.[hc]:
		ntfs_inode_mark_dirty(),
		ntfs_inode_sync().
	- Change ntfs_inode_close() to write out dirty inodes and inode extents.
	- New API functions provided by lcnalloc.[hc]:
		ntfs_cluster_{alloc,free}(). -- WIP
	- New API function provided by bitmap.[hc]:
		ntfs_bitmap_{set,clear}_run(). -- WIP
	- Extend the volume.h::ntfs_volume structure with variables required by
	  the cluster and mft allocators and set them up in
	  volume.c::ntfs_volume_startup().
	- ntfs_umount() now also does an fdatasync() on the device before
	  closing it.
	- Added new utility ntfstruncate, primarily to be able to test the
	  new ntfs_attr_truncate() function, it is not compiled by default.
	  Note, the library can currently only make attributes smaller and it
	  only works on uncompressed, unencrypted inodes which do not contain
	  attribute lists, i.e. on simple files, but that was quite a lot of
	  new code in itself which needs a lot of testing!
	- Fix library to never issue writes on volumes that have been mounted
	  read-only.
	- New API provided by mft.[hc]:
		ntfs_mft_record_{alloc,free}(). -- WIP

12/03/2002 - 1.6.0 - More mkntfs options and cleanups.
	Fix typo in usage information of mkntfs. Thanks to Richard Russon for
	spotting it.
	Change version number in mkntfs and ntfsfix to match the linux-ntfs
	release version number.
	Added two new options to mkntfs; -I, which disables content indexing
	on the volume and -C, which enables compression on the volume.

01/02/2002 - Attempt to fix compile warnings on powerpc.
	Attempt to fix compile warnings on powerpc. It seems powerpc uses
	char == unsigned char which was breaking some signed comparisons.

26/01/2002 - 1.5.1 - Fix two buglets in ntfsfix and more compilation fixes.
	Fix two silly buglets in ntfsfix, where we were calling is_baad_record
	instead of is_baad_recordp. Silly me... Thanks to David Martinez Moreno
	for reporting the compilation warnings on ia64 which led me to find the
	bug.
	Fix compilation problems in logfile.h on big endian arches. Hopefully,
	now will really compile on all arches.

10/01/2002 - 1.5.0 - Fix bug in $LogFile size calculation.
	Fix bug in $LogFile size calculation where we would take the size to
	be zero on partitions between 200 and 400MiB in size.
	Add requirement for linux-ntfs to linux-ntfs-devel.

15/12/2001 - Remove atomic ops and add compiler version check.
	Hopefully this will preempt "it doesn't compile for me" messages from
	people with gcc < 2.96.
	Change bail out error check for seek to backup boot sector to a warning
	since SuSE 7.2 + loads of stuff and 2.5.1-pre11 returns EINVAL instead
	of ENOSPC.
	Remove atomic code as it isn't defined on non-i386 arches.

06/12/2001 - Change ntfs_mount to accept second argument for mount flags.
	ntfs_mount() now supports mount flags as per "man 2 mount". Currently
	only the MS_RDONLY flag is supported/implemented. This breaks
	compatibility with older libntfs versions and hence the major version
	number of the library has been increased.
	Adapt utilities to make use of new ntfs_mount syntax.

17/11/2001 - Add description of compression algorithm.

09/11/2001 - 1.4.0 - Major fix in mkntfs, small update to ntfsfix and others.
	Update ntfsfix to support Windows XP NTFS volumes (NTFS 3.1).
	Update layout.h with more information.
	(Re)enable shared libraries.
	Changes to mkntfs:
	  - Correct handling of directories on volumes with cluster sizes
	    above 4096 bytes.
	  - Lower minimum size of NTFS partitions to 1MiB, scaling down the
	    logfile size as necessary.
	  - Support a wider range of input parameters. Now should have all
	    valid combinations covered.
	  - Update man page.
	  - Implement better determination of device size.
	  - Various bug fixes.

22/08/2001 - 1.2.2 - Small fix in mkntfs and minor updates.
	Small fix in mkntfs for small volumes with non-standard sector sizes,
	where the default values would result in a sector size smaller than the
	sector size and mkntfs would refuse to run because of this. The man
	page was updated accordingly.
	Minor updates/clarifications to include/layout.h.

02/08/2001 - 1.2.1 - Added ntfsfix man page and minor cleanup.
	David Martínez Moreno <david.martinez@rediris.es> donated a man page
	for ntfsfix as well as spelling mistake fixes all over the place.

26/07/2001 - 1.2.0 - Important bug fixes to mkntfs.
	Bug fixes for cluster sizes > 4kb involving corrections to mft mirror
	size and contents, mft data attribute position and mft bitmap size.
	Some of those were nasty so this is a major improvement. Hopefully these
	were the last bugs.

25/07/2001 - 1.0.2 - Small cleanup of the distribution.
	Move mkntfs to sbin (was put in bin before).
	Small bugfix to mkntfs man page.

24/07/2001 - 1.0.1 - Small cleanup of the distribution.
	Confirmed that at least gcc-2.96 is needed to compile linux-ntfs.
	Removed ldm.c from linux-ntfs. It will reappear as ldminfo.c in a new
	package, probably linux-ldm.
	Taken out some file from the distribution, but they are still present
	in CVS. This is because they are not really useful except if you are
	a developer wanting to play about.

10/06/2001 - 1.0.0 - mkntfs release and bugfixes to ntfslib and the others.
	Also, released ldm which dumps the ldm database on Win2k/XP dynamic
	disks.
	A man page for mkntfs is also installed by make install so man 8 mkntfs
	can be used to show the recognised command line options.
	Building of shared libraries is disabled by default as it breaks on
	some systems.
	Probably need at least gcc-2.95 or something like that from now on.

02/02/2001 - Started ChangeLog.
