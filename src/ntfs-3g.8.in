.TH NTFS-3G 8 "March 2009" "ntfs-3g @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
ntfs-3g \- Third Generation Read/Write NTFS Driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ntfs-3g
\fB[-o \fIoption\fP\fB[,...]]\fR
.I volume mount_point
.br
.B mount \-t ntfs-3g
\fB[-o \fIoption\fP\fB[,...]]\fR
.I volume mount_point
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBntfs-3g\fR is an NTFS driver, which can
create, remove, rename, move files, directories, hard links, and
streams; it can read and write files, including 
streams and sparse files; it can handle special files like 
symbolic links, devices, and FIFOs; moreover it can also read
transparently compressed files.
.PP
The \fIvolume\fR to be mounted can be either a block device or 
an image file.
.SS Access Handling and Security
By default, files and directories are owned by the effective 
user and group of the mounting process and everybody has
full read, write, execution and directory browsing permissions.
If you want to use permissions handling then use the
.B uid
and/or the
.B gid 
options together with the 
.B umask,
or
.B fmask
and
.B dmask
options.
.PP
Windows users have full access to the files created by 
.B ntfs-3g.
.PP
Full ownership and permission support, including Windows user mapping
and POSIX file system compliance, is provided by the Advanced NTFS-3G 
driver.
.PP
If 
.B ntfs-3g 
is set setuid-root then non-root users will 
be also able to mount volumes.
.SS Windows Filename Compatibility
NTFS supports several filename namespaces: DOS, Win32 and POSIX. While the
\fBntfs-3g\fR driver handles all of them, it always creates new files in the 
POSIX namespace for maximum portability and interoperability reasons. 
This means that filenames are case sensitive and all characters are
allowed except '/' and '\\0'. This is perfectly legal on Windows, though
some application may get confused. If you find so then please report it
to the developer of the relevant Windows software.
.SS Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
NTFS stores all data in streams. Every file has exactly one unnamed
data stream and can have many named data streams.  The size of a file is the
size of its unnamed data stream.  By default, \fBntfs-3g\fR will only read
the unnamed data stream.
.PP
By using the options "streams_interface=windows", you will be able to read
any named data streams, simply by specifying the stream's name after a colon.
For example:
.RS
.sp
cat some.mp3:artist
.sp
.RE
Named data streams act like normals files, so you can read from them, write to
them and even delete them (using rm).  You can list all the named data streams
a file has by getting the "ntfs.streams.list" extended attribute.
.SH OPTIONS
Most of the generic mount options described in 
. BR mount (8)
are
supported (ro, rw, suid, nosuid, dev, nodev, exec, noexec). 
Below is a summary of the options that \fBntfs-3g\fR additionally 
accepts.
.TP
\fBuid=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBgid=\fP\fIvalue\fP
Set the owner and the group of files and directories. The values are numerical.
The defaults are the uid and gid of the current process.
.TP
.BI umask= value
Set the  bitmask of the file and directory permissions that are not
present. The value is given in octal. The default value is 0 which
means full access to everybody.
.TP
.BI fmask= value
Set the  bitmask of the file permissions that are not present. 
The value is given in octal. The default value is 0 which
means full access to everybody.
.TP
.BI dmask= value
Set the  bitmask of the directory permissions that are not
present. The value is given in octal. The default value is 0 which
means full access to everybody.
.TP
.B ro
Mount filesystem read\-only. Useful if Windows is hibernated.
.TP
.B remove_hiberfile
Unlike in case of read-only mount, the read-write mount is denied if 
the NTFS volume is hibernated. One needs either to resume Windows and
shutdown it properly, or use this option which will remove the Windows
hibernation file. Please note, this means that the saved Windows 
session will be completely lost. Use this option for your own 
responsibility.
.TP
.B recover, norecover
Recover and repair a corrupted or inconsistent 
NTFS volume if it's possible. The default behaviour is 
.B recover.
.TP
.B atime, noatime, relatime
The 
.B atime 
option updates inode access time for each access.

The 
.B noatime 
option disables inode access time updates which can speed up
file operations and prevent sleeping (notebook) disks spinning 
up too often thus saving energy and disk lifetime.

The
.B relatime 
option is very similar to 
.B noatime. 
It  updates inode access times relative to modify or change time. 
The access time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier 
than the current modify or change time. Unlike
.B noatime
this option doesn't break applications that need to know 
if a file has been read since the last time it was modified.
This is the default behaviour.
.TP
.B show_sys_files
Show the system files in directory listings. 
Otherwise the default behaviour is to hide the system files.
Please note that even when this option is specified, "$MFT"
may not be visible due to a glibc bug.
Furthermore, irrespectively of show_sys_files, all
files are accessible by name, for example you can always do
"ls \-l '$UpCase'".
.TP
.BI max_read= value
With this option the maximum size of read operations can be set.
The default is infinite.  Note that the size of read requests is
limited anyway to 32 pages (which is 128kbyte on i386).
.TP
.B silent
Do not return error for chown and chmod unless access right 
handling is turned on by either of the
.B uid,
.B gid,
.B umask,
.B fmask,
or
.B dmask
option. 
This option is on by default.
.TP
.BI locale= value
Prints informative and diagnostic messages in the set locale.
.TP
.B no_def_opts
By default ntfs-3g acts as "silent" was passed to it,
this option cancel this behaviour.
.TP
.BI streams_interface= value
This option controls how the user can access Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
or in other words, named data streams. It can be set
to, one of \fBnone\fR, \fBwindows\fR or \fBxattr\fR. If the option is set to
\fBnone\fR, the user will have no access to the named data streams.  If it's set
to \fBwindows\fR, then the user can access them just like in Windows (eg. cat
file:stream). If it's set to \fBxattr\fR, then the named data streams are
mapped to xattrs and user can manipulate them using \fB{get,set}fattr\fR
utilities. The default is \fBxattr\fR on Linux, \fBnone\fR on other OSes.
.TP
.B force
This mount option is not used anymore. It was superseded by the
.B recover
and
.B norecover
options.
.TP
.B debug
Makes ntfs-3g to not detach from terminal and print a lot of driver debug output.
.TP
.B no_detach
Same as above but with less debug output.
.SH EXAMPLES
Mount /dev/sda1 to /mnt/windows (make sure /mnt/windows exists):
.RS
.sp
.B ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows
.sp
.RE
or
.RS
.sp
.B mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows
.sp
.RE
Read\-only mount /dev/sda5 to /home/user/mnt and make user with uid 1000 
to be the owner of all files:
.RS
.sp
.B ntfs-3g \-o ro,uid=1000 /dev/sda5 /home/user/mnt
.sp
.RE
/etc/fstab entry for the above:
.RS
.sp
.B /dev/sda5 /home/user/mnt ntfs\-3g ro,uid=1000 0 0
.sp
.RE
Unmount /mnt/windows:
.RS
.sp
.B umount /mnt/windows
.sp
.RE
.SH EXIT CODES
To facilitate the use of the
.B ntfs-3g
driver in scripts, an exit code is returned to give an indication of the 
mountability status of a volume. Value 0 means success, and all other
ones mean an error. The unique error codes are documented in the
.BR ntfs-3g.probe (8)
manual page.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
